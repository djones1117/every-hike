## Every Hike

This application allows users to share information and photos about hiking trails. Users can share the hikes difficulty, trail-name, location, trail-length, and a photo of the hike. The users posts will display on their profile page. Users can look at other users profile pages and interact with their post by creating a favorite or deleting a favorite.
